It is equally \ngratifying to note that the University has gained recognition nationwide \nas a Centre of excellence in Computer Science having been so designated \nby the National Universities Commission. In pursuit of this, the \nUniversity obtained internet connectivity towards the end of 1998, \nacquired its VSAT facility in 2003 and by 2005/2006 academic session \nstudents' registration was conducted on-line. Now the members of the \nUniversity community can easily access information the world over on \nthe super highway. Student Union elections are also conducted online.  \nIn pursuance of academic excellence in solving human problems, \nProfessor S.A. G arba of the Department of Microbiology in the last \nquarter of 1996 led a team of researchers in the development and \nproduction of typhoid fever vaccine. This project was sponsored by the \nUnipetrol Nigeria, Plc. Several years later, the team was able to develop \nand produce typhoid fever vaccines and having completed the testing on \nmice, guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys, the vaccine was tested on \nhumans with amazing success. \nFor the purpose of generating internal revenue to supplement \ngovernment funds, the University established the FUTMIN \nVENTURES, a consultancy outfit.

The \nCCCFR in collaboration with environmen talists in the six Geopolitical \nZones of Nigeria then concluded a N105 million National Agro-Climatic \nAtlas Project to combat effects of climate change induced natural disaster \nin Nigeria sponsored by the Ecological Fund Office of the Presidency. \nApart from this project, the Centre is into collaborative climate change \nstudies with University of Cape Town,  South Africa, while its scientists \ncontinue as consulting experts with United Nations Agencies like \nUNFCCC, WMO, UNEP, UNDP, FAO, UNESCO etc. The Centre is \nalso involved in the University's Sustainable Livelihood Initiative in the \ncontext of the UN decade of \nEducation for Sustainable Development (2005 – 2018). \nThe Centre for Human Settlements and Urban Development (CHSUD) \nwhich was established by th e University in collaboration with the UN \nHabitat is to assist in settlements, urban governance and urban \ndevelopment. Since then, CHSUD has focused attention on building \ncapacity at all levels of government, for effective urban environmental \nmanagement su ch as establishment of Environmental Management \nInformation System, Certificate and Postgraduate Diploma Programmes \nin Public-Private Partnership for Urban Environment. With partnership \nof UNDP and Yale University, USA, CHSUD has carried out \nconsultancy se rvices for UN -Habitat, in four Nigerian cities (Ibadan, \nEnugu, Kano and Karu) on the use of implementation instruments for \nsustainable cities programme. In its effort to contribute to the \ndevelopment of manpower for urban environmental management in \nNigeria, CHSUD is in the process of designing  post-graduate courses \n(M.Sc. and PhD) in City Planning and Urban Design, with the support of",

The Centre also runs 12 -months IJMB \nprogramme, whose successful candidates are admitted as Direct  Entry \nstudents at 200 level. \nIn the area of domestic and foreign linkages and collaboration, the  \nManagement of the University also created a Directorate to cater for this \nimportant function of networking.

Other centers are CODeL, CGEB, QAP, NCDMB, \nILCR, and ACEMFS. \nIn line with the directive of the Secretary to the Federal Government on \nMarch 2003 that SERVICOM units should be established in all \nMinistries, Parastatals, Departments and Institutions, SERVICOM Unit \nwas established in Federal University of Technology, Minna in \nSeptember, 2007; with a Vision to make FUT Minna one of Nigeria's \nleading University and a Centre of excellence through efficient service \ndelivery, punctuality to work, presence on seats, performance  and \ncitizens' satisfaction. In line with SERVICOM principles, each \nSERVICOM unit has four critical positions namely: Nodal Officer; \nCharter Desk Officer; Customer Care/Complaints Desk Officer; and \nService Improvement Desk Officer. \nThe Advancement Office has been in existence since 2008. It was \nformally known and call ed Advancement and Development Office \n(ADO). It is worthy to note that this Unit was formally under a \nDirectorate System headed by a Director. In July 2015, the  University \nManagement reviewed the system in-line with what is obtainable in other \nsister institutions, and approved the Unit to be under the Registry \nDepartment. \nThe principle underlying the establishment of Advancement Office is to \neffectively collect the various resources and harness them towards \nachieving goals of the University. With the declin e in government \nfunding for Universities it has become prudent for the University to \nsource for funds for its development. Advancement Office has therefore \nbecome paramount in mapping out strategies, cultivating cordial \nrelationships with the Alumni, various corporate bodies and international \nbodies in achieving the set goals.",

One of the recent achievements of \nthe Advancement Office is the Institution of “Leave a Legacy Project” a \nproject of graduating students which has yearly rolled out useful projects \nfor the general welfare of all students in the University. \nThe Anti -Corruption and Transparency Monitoring Unit (ACTU)  was \nestablished in Federal University of Technology, Minna in June, 2008 \nand formally inaugurated by the Independent Corrupt Practices \nCommission (ICPC), Abuja on 7th March, 2011 as part of Federal \nGovernment directives to parastatals to establish such to assist the ICPC \nin fighting corruption. The Vision of ACTU is to be the foremost “agent \nof change”, in th e war against corruption and corrupt practices in the \npolity, and thereby restore Nigeria to the enviable standard of \nrespectability, dignity and honour within the country of nations. The \nmission of ACTU is to employ all available legal means to rid Nigeria of \ngreed, avarice and all vestiges of corruption and thus promote \ntransparency, probity, accountability and integrity in the public and \nprivate lives of all Nigerians. \nMost recently, on the 26th of Februa ry, 2016, the Federal University of \nTechnology Entrepreneurship Centre was established with the primary  \ngoal of institutionalizing the development of entrepreneurship skills in \nstudents across all departments and schools in the University through \neffective training and other interventions to enable the m discover and \ndevelop beneficial enterprises by synergizing with the private sector, \npolicy-makers, philanthropists and non -governmental organizations \ncommitted to economic empowerment and sustainable development. \nThe University has also honoured some dis tinguished gentlemen and",
